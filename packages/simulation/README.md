# drillgame_simulation

Canonical, deterministic Drillgame gameplay simulation: `WorldState`, its single fixed-tick
transition, terrain, rigs, drilling, hazards, economy, contracts, expeditions, rescue,
deterministic RNG, map discovery, replication sections and state hashing.

No IO, clocks, rendering, async runtime or networking dependencies (`serde` only).

## The transition

`WorldState::simulate_tick(tick, &TickInputs) -> TickOutput` is the only gameplay transition.
Every other mutator is `pub(crate)` and runs inside it. Outside this crate it is called only by
`drillgame_netcode`'s `NetSimulation` impl (host ticks and client prediction) and by tests.

- `TickInputs`: per player, held `ControlState` (quantized horizontal axis, thrust, drill) and
  one-shot `TickAction`s (`PlayerCommand`: bomb, scanner, infrastructure, rescue and every town
  service transaction, validated against the acting rig's building).
- `TickOutput`: gameplay events with stable `(tick, ordinal)` ids, one `ActionOutcome` per
  action, the tick's terrain tile writes (`terrain_ops`) and newly discovered tiles per player
  (`discoveries`).

The tick rate is a session parameter (`SimulationParams`, default 60 Hz); gameplay constants
are authored per second and derived per tick once at world creation (`TickTiming`).

## World modules (`src/world/`)

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `simulate` | the tick: inputs, hazards, bombs, drilling, day cycle, escape, deep rewards |
| `movement`, `commands`, `services`, `progression`, `hazards`, `rescue` | gameplay rules used by the tick |
| `roster` | `add_player` / `remove_player`; spawn placement on an unbounded grid so any number of rigs spawn without overlap |
| `discovery` | `DiscoveredTiles` (16x16 chunk bitsets; positions in JSON saves, bitsets in binary keyframes), clamped allocation-free reveals, `Discovery` op-log entries |
| `player_sections` | how a `Player` splits into per-tick `PlayerRig`, public `RigBuild` and private `PlayerInventory` |
| `replication` | per-tick state, live entities, op log and on-change sections (`SectionKey` / `SectionPayload`) |
| `visibility` | what one client may see: `SectionKey::visible_to`, `redacted_for`, `visible_state_hash` |
| `state_hash` | the stable world hash (`simulation_state_hash`) and the client-visible variant |
| `import`, `timing` | building worlds (new game, legacy imports) and per-tick constants |

## World generation (`src/worldgen/`)

A world is a pure function of its `WorldSettings` (seed, `WorldSize`, `ResourceRichness`,
`HazardIntensity`, `GeneratorVersion`). The settings live in the `Terrain` (saved, hashed, and
carried in the session section); `Terrain::generate` builds a world and `Terrain::band_at` /
`deep_stratum_at` answer which layer a tile is in. Saves without settings are legacy worlds
(`GeneratorVersion::Legacy`, the original fixed-depth generator).

### Compact terrain (`terrain/persistence.rs`)

A `Terrain` serializes as a `TerrainSnapshot`: its `WorldSettings`, size, digest and only the
tiles that differ from freshly generated terrain (`TileDiffs`, row-major, written as runs of
`Tile::code`s). Saves (v6) and network keyframes both use it. Deserializing regenerates the base
(`Terrain::regenerate`), applies the diffs and checks the digest; a mismatch
(`TerrainRestoreError::DigestMismatch`: a snapshot from a different generator build, or
corrupted) and an unknown generator version are errors, never panics. Legacy-generator worlds
of any size (and old saves extended with `ensure_depth`) work the same way, since the legacy
generator is deterministic too. Other APIs: `generation_diffs` / `from_generation_diffs`
(position-keyed diffs, applicable in any order and idempotent), `chunk_diffs` /
`apply_chunk_diffs` for relevance refreshes, and `FullTerrain`, the pre-v6 every-tile form kept
for save migration.

Changing what a generator version produces breaks its existing saves (the digest check refuses
them): ship generator changes as a new `GeneratorVersion`.

The generated base is memoized per process (a few bases keyed by settings and size): a host, its
clients and tests rebuild the same world many times. Whole-world generation is kept, not lazy
per-chunk generation: caves, hazards and deposits are placed per region across chunk borders,
so a chunk cannot be generated alone cheaply, and a whole world is fast enough. Measured with
`generation_timing_report` (`cargo test -p drillgame_simulation generation_timing_report --
--ignored --nocapture`):

| World | Debug generate | Release generate | Restore with cached base (debug / release) |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 standard (240x220) | 118 ms | 11.5 ms | 2.1 ms / 0.3 ms |
| V1 large (360x220) | 176 ms | 17.2 ms | 2.7 ms / 0.4 ms |
| Legacy (240x220) | 13 ms | 1.4 ms | 2.1 ms / 0.3 ms |

Generation is integer-only (fixed-point value noise, splitmix hashing, region-seeded RNG) so a
seed is bit-identical everywhere:

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `strata` | the band stack (`Band`): fixed order, per-seed boundary shifts, waves along x and interleaved fingers |
| `caves` | smoothed noise caverns, worm tunnels and deep chambers; crust, town and spawn-shaft protection |
| `hazards` | clustered hazard pockets by band rules, scaled by intensity; clearance around spawn and town |
| `deposits` | per-mineral depth curves, veins / pods / motherlodes, per-band ore budgets, the starter field, artifact beds, prefab slot reservation |
| `features` | `FeatureIndex`: caverns, chambers, motherlodes, artifact beds, hazard clusters, stratum transitions and prefab slots, queryable by kind, band, depth, region or proximity (`WorldState::world_features`, recomputed from settings, never replicated) |
| `report` | `WorldStats` and the distribution report behind `--worldgen-report` |
| `noise` | integer value / fractal / ridge noise and `RegionRng` |

The fairness suite (`worldgen/tests.rs`) checks every sampled seed for a fixed surface and
town, caves and hazards clear of spawn and the town, clustered hazards, a starter field worth
the first upgrades, per-band ore value within target, ore never harder than its band's drill, a
path to the bottom with each band's own drill, artifacts in every stratum and feature counts in
bounds, plus golden digests pinned to `GeneratorVersion::V1`. `DRILLGAME_WORLDGEN_SEEDS=300
cargo test --release -p drillgame_simulation worldgen` runs it over more seeds.

## Replication

Every field belongs to exactly one section kind (the compiler enforces it through exhaustive
destructuring in `section`, `remove_player`, `redact_player` and `split_player`):

| Kind | Contents | Who receives it |
|---|---|---|
| Per tick | rig pose, velocity, fuel, hull, drill/scanner timers, deep-run pressure; gas clouds, boulders, bombs | clients the rig/entity is relevant to |
| Op log | terrain tile writes | everyone, filtered by 16x16 terrain chunk relevance (stale chunks are refreshed with `terrain_chunk`: the chunk's diffs from generation) |
| Op log | per-player discovery | the owner only |
| On change | `RigBuild(player)`: upgrade levels drawn on the rig | everyone |
| On change | `Loadout(player)`: inventory, credits, upgrades, kits, rig parts, salvage, rescue count, deep reward milestone, service transactions | the owner only |
| On change | economy, contracts, progression (incl. `won_game`), town, world events, infrastructure, markers, RNG, timers, session constants (tick timing, player template, world settings) | everyone |

Because other players' private state never reaches a client, replica checks compare
`visible_state_hash(viewer)`: private state is hashed only for the viewer and per-player data is
hashed player by player, so host and a correct client authority agree exactly. Terrain
dimensions, settings and the tiles that differ from generation travel only in keyframes
(`redacted_for(viewer)`); the receiver regenerates the rest.
