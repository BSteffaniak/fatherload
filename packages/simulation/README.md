# drillgame_simulation

Canonical, deterministic Drillgame gameplay simulation: `WorldState`, its single fixed-tick
transition, terrain, rigs, drilling, hazards, economy, contracts, expeditions, rescue,
deterministic RNG, map discovery, replication sections and state hashing.

No IO, clocks, rendering, async runtime or networking dependencies (`serde` only).

## The transition

`WorldState::simulate_tick(tick, &TickInputs) -> TickOutput` is the only gameplay transition.
Every other mutator is `pub(crate)` and runs inside it. Outside this crate it is called only by
`drillgame_netcode`'s `NetSimulation` impl (host ticks and client prediction) and by tests.

- `TickInputs`: per player, held `ControlState` (quantized horizontal axis, thrust, drill) and
  one-shot `TickAction`s (`PlayerCommand`: bomb, scanner, infrastructure, rescue, test-mode
  toggles and warps, and every town service transaction, validated against the acting rig's
  building).

Drilling (`world/commands.rs`): the rig drills down or sideways only while resting on solid
ground (`DrillContact`). The drill mount upgrade (`Player::drill_mount_level`, in the public
`RigBuild`) adds sideways drilling in flight (tier 1, gimbal) and drilling up into a ceiling the
rig thrusts against (tier 2, crown bore, `DrillDirection::Up`). The shop gates both tiers on the
world's deepest tile reaching a band (`economy::upgrade_locked_by`). Drill pace: a drill tier
sets the chip rate (`player::drill_speed`, floored at `MIN_DRILL_SECONDS_PER_CHIP`, about three
ticks at 60 Hz) and, from tier 6, the durability each chip takes off (`player::drill_bite`, up to
5), so a maxed drill clears hard rock in about 0.15 s at every tick rate. Lava and magma vents
are drillable (they turn to air and burn the rig, see hazard counters); building foundations
and vault fixtures are not, except in test mode. `terrain::is_indestructible` names tiles no
drill can ever dig (the place for a bedrock floor); every drill path checks it.

Upgrades (`economy.rs`): fourteen shop lines, offer index = position in `UpgradeKind::ALL` (the
drill mount stays at `DRILL_MOUNT_OFFER_INDEX` 8). The core lines (drill, fuel tank, cargo bay,
engine, hull, radiator) run to tier 15, the scanner to 10, each hazard counter to 6-8. Prices
grow geometrically per tier from a cheap first purchase (`upgrade_cost`); stat curves live in
`player.rs` (`cargo_capacity_for_level` ~300 at the top, `fuel_capacity_for_level` ~3,000,
`hull_capacity_for_level` ~2,500, `engine_power` ~4x with handling/climb speed capped).
Capacities are stored, so a save from the old five-tier curves keeps its levels; loading it
(`WorldState::catch_up_capacity_curves`, run by the game's save loader) lifts the tank and bay
onto the new curve for the fitted tiers, keeping bonuses earned on top. Levels load whatever
their value.

Hazard counters (`protection.rs`, `Player::hazard_gear`, private loadout): Heat Shielding,
Lava Plating, Gas Scrubber, Pressure Bracing (pressure pockets, explosive pockets, magma vents)
and Boulder Deflector (boulders, cave-ins). Each stops `1 - (1 - tier/max)^2` of its hazard, all
of it at the top tier. Heat is per band, not per row: each band has a heat level
(`band_heat_level`, 0 in the topsoil and clay up to 10 in the mantle storm zone) and the rig's
cooling (`heat_cooling`, counted in thirds of a level: a whole level per radiator tier to
tier 5, a third per radiator tier after that, a whole level per shielding tier) covers that
much; each uncovered third burns `HEAT_DAMAGE_PER_EXCESS_UNIT` hull per second (3 per level). Deep-run instability builds from the
basalt deeps down and the pressure fuel drain/scanner lockout starts at the fossil oceans (both
by band). Boulders loosened by mining are one per 80 stone tiles with a 1.5 s warning.

Test mode (`test_mode.rs`, `world/test_mode.rs`): `WorldState::enable_test_mode` (before play)
maxes every rig (hazard counters included) and the player template, fills the parts locker and
grants credits. Test-mode rigs drill any tile but an indestructible one in a single chip,
ignoring hardness; with the invulnerable toggle on (`WorldState::damage_immune`) no source
damages a hull (and no damage events fire);
`PlayerCommand::TestMode` toggles invulnerable hulls / infinite fuel (refilled every tick) or
warps the acting rig into a carved, hazard-free pocket at the top of a band. Depth records and
deep-reward milestones are skipped. The toggles replicate as the shared `SectionKey::TestMode`
section and save with the world.
- `TickOutput`: gameplay events with stable `(tick, ordinal)` ids, one `ActionOutcome` per
  action, the tick's terrain tile writes (`terrain_ops`) and newly discovered tiles per player
  (`discoveries`).

The tick rate is a session parameter (`SimulationParams`, default 60 Hz); gameplay constants
are authored per second and derived per tick once at world creation (`TickTiming`).

## World modules (`src/world/`)

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `simulate` | the tick: inputs, hazards, bombs, drilling, day cycle, escape, deep rewards |
| `movement`, `commands`, `services`, `progression`, `hazards`, `rescue` | gameplay rules used by the tick |
| `quests` | quest services (accept, turn in, abandon at the giver's counter), objectives stepping inside the tick, twists, rewards, reputation rebates, blueprint fragments |
| `roster` | `add_player` / `remove_player`; spawn placement on an unbounded grid so any number of rigs spawn without overlap |
| `discovery` | `DiscoveredTiles` (16x16 chunk bitsets; positions in JSON saves, bitsets in binary keyframes), clamped allocation-free reveals, `Discovery` op-log entries |
| `player_sections` | how a `Player` splits into per-tick `PlayerRig`, public `RigBuild` and private `PlayerInventory` |
| `replication` | per-tick state, live entities, op log and on-change sections (`SectionKey` / `SectionPayload`) |
| `visibility` | what one client may see: `SectionKey::visible_to`, `redacted_for`, `visible_state_hash` |
| `state_hash` | the stable world hash (`simulation_state_hash`) and the client-visible variant |
| `import`, `timing` | building worlds (new game, legacy imports) and per-tick constants |
| `test_mode` | test-mode setup, per-tick refills and the band warp |

## World generation (`src/worldgen/`)

A world is a pure function of its `WorldSettings` (seed, `WorldSize`, `ResourceRichness`,
`HazardIntensity`, `GeneratorVersion`). The settings live in the `Terrain` (saved, hashed, and
carried in the session section); `Terrain::generate` builds a world and `Terrain::band_at` /
`deep_stratum_at` answer which layer a tile is in. Saves without settings are legacy worlds
(`GeneratorVersion::Legacy`, the original fixed-depth generator).

### Compact terrain (`terrain/persistence.rs`)

A `Terrain` serializes as a `TerrainSnapshot`: its `WorldSettings`, size, digest and only the
tiles that differ from freshly generated terrain (`TileDiffs`, row-major, written as runs of
`Tile::code`s). Saves (v6) and network keyframes both use it. Deserializing regenerates the base
(`Terrain::regenerate`), applies the diffs and checks the digest; a mismatch
(`TerrainRestoreError::DigestMismatch`: a snapshot from a different generator build, or
corrupted) and an unknown generator version are errors, never panics. Legacy-generator worlds
of any size (and old saves extended with `ensure_depth`) work the same way, since the legacy
generator is deterministic too. Other APIs: `generation_diffs` / `from_generation_diffs`
(position-keyed diffs, applicable in any order and idempotent), `chunk_diffs` /
`apply_chunk_diffs` for relevance refreshes, and `FullTerrain`, the pre-v6 every-tile form kept
for save migration.

Changing what a generator version produces breaks its existing saves (the digest check refuses
them): ship generator changes as a new `GeneratorVersion`.

The generated base is memoized per process (a few bases keyed by settings and size): a host, its
clients and tests rebuild the same world many times. Whole-world generation is kept, not lazy
per-chunk generation: caves, hazards and deposits are placed per region across chunk borders,
so a chunk cannot be generated alone cheaply, and a whole world is fast enough. Measured with
`generation_timing_report` (`cargo test -p drillgame_simulation generation_timing_report --
--ignored --nocapture`):

| World | Debug generate | Release generate | Restore with cached base (debug / release) |
|---|---|---|---|
| V4 standard (240x860) | 489 ms | 44 ms | 6.4 ms / 1.1 ms |
| V4 large (360x900) | 1086 ms | 68 ms | 9.5 ms / 1.6 ms |
| V3 standard (240x220) | 122 ms | 11.1 ms | 2.1 ms / 0.3 ms |
| Legacy (240x220) | 14 ms | 1.4 ms | 2.2 ms / 0.5 ms |

A compact snapshot of a lightly dug world stays around 6 KB whatever the world's depth.

Generation is integer-only (fixed-point value noise, splitmix hashing, region-seeded RNG) so a
seed is bit-identical everywhere:

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `strata` | the band stack (`Band`): fixed order, per-seed boundary bases (V1/V2: small shifts; V3: a cumulative thickness model with minimum gaps; V4: the same model for every band of a world about four times deeper, `WorldSize::deep_height_tiles`), waves along x and interleaved fingers (V4: wide transition zones of lenses), the V4 bedrock floor (`bedrock_top_row`), `band_layout_rows` for placement passes, and `nominal_row` / `scaled_row` / `nominal_depth` / `scaled_span`, which map a world's rows onto the classic ~220-row stack so depth rules authored against it (mineral curves, hazard gates, heat, deep-run pressure, deep rewards, quest depths) stretch with deeper worlds |
| `caves` | smoothed noise caverns, worm tunnels and deep chambers; crust, town and spawn-shaft protection |
| `hazards` | clustered hazard pockets by band rules, scaled by intensity; clearance around spawn and town |
| `deposits` | per-mineral depth curves (classic nominal rows), veins / pods / motherlodes, per-band ore budgets, the starter field, artifact beds (V4: more per band, spread through it), prefab slot reservation (V1); V3+ rich worlds thin deep ore specks into fewer, chunkier deposits |
| `prefabs` | hand-authored POI rooms as char grids with a shared legend (size limits, random fills, switch slots) |
| `pois` | V2+: POI placement in a per-band region grid (guaranteed kinds, random fills, depth windows, spacing, hazard clearance, spawn/town exclusion; V4 stacks a row of regions per tier of about 22 rows, fills more of them at random, and adds an extra supply cache per tier, keeping the classic POI density per row) and stamping (flips, shuffled lock orders, band ore/artifacts/guardian hazards); empty regions become reserved prefab slots |
| `features` | `FeatureIndex`: caverns, chambers, motherlodes, artifact beds, hazard clusters, stratum transitions, prefab slots and points of interest, queryable by kind, band, depth, region or proximity, plus POI queries (`pois`, `pois_of(kind)`, `pois_in_band`, `poi_at(position)`, `nearest_poi(position, kind)`) for quests to bind to (`WorldState::world_features`, recomputed from settings and cached per settings, never replicated) |
| `report` | `WorldStats` and the distribution report behind `--worldgen-report` |
| `noise` | integer value / fractal / ridge noise and `RegionRng` |

The fairness suite (`worldgen/tests.rs`) checks every sampled seed for a fixed surface and
town, caves and hazards clear of spawn and the town, clustered hazards, a starter field worth
the first upgrades, per-band ore value within target, ore never harder than its band's drill, a
path to the bottom with each band's own drill, artifacts in every stratum and feature counts in
bounds, V3 and V4 band thicknesses within bounds and varying by seed, V4 transition zones that
interleave over many rows, a solid V4 bedrock floor that nothing breaks, few deep ore specks on
rich V3+ worlds, plus golden digests pinned to `GeneratorVersion::V1`, `V2`, `V3` and `V4`. `worldgen/poi_tests.rs`
checks POI counts per band and per kind, caches in the clay, grey stone and slate, spacing,
spawn/town/hazard clearance, nothing undiggable below spawn, and that every vault's doors,
switches, relays and seals can be reached and worked from spawn. `DRILLGAME_WORLDGEN_SEEDS=300
cargo test --release -p drillgame_simulation worldgen` runs it over more seeds.

## Points of interest (`src/poi.rs`, `src/world/pois.rs`)

Generator v2 worlds hold supply caches, derelict rigs, vaults (sequence switches, pressure
seals, twin relays), formations (fossil beds, geodes) and rival claims (`PoiKind`,
`PoiVariant`). They are built from `TileKind::Poi(PoiTile)` fixtures: crates, wreckage and
salvage cores, vault walls/doors/seals/switches/relays/caches (vault fixtures are undrillable
and blast-proof; a seal vents only under a bomb), fossil shale, geode shells, outpost plating
and lockers. A POI's state lives in its tiles (opened crates are gone, switches light, doors
vanish), so it replicates through the terrain op log and saves with the terrain; the twin-relay
deadlines ride in the timers section and each player's `PoiJournal` (known sites, recovered
logs) in their private loadout.

Drilling a crate, salvage core, vault cache or outpost locker pays a deterministic reward from
the world seed, the tile and its depth tier (tables in `poi.rs`; tuned as a top-up next to ore
sales); a vault hands out an unowned rare part first, then a fragment of the opener's next
vault blueprint, and a permanent fitting once those blueprints are all finished. Entering a POI
records a visit; a scanner pulse records the POIs in range as echoes (tiers 1-2) or identified
silhouettes (tier 3+, or the relic scanner). Events: `PoiOpened`, `PoiDiscovered`,
`VaultOpened`, `VaultLockReset`.

## Side quests (`src/quest.rs`, `src/quest/`, `src/world/quests.rs`)

Plan §8's quest engine. Quests are data (`quest/content.rs`): a `QuestDef` names its giver
(`QuestGiver`: the keepers Kade, Mara, Nix, Iona and Pip, plus Director Vale's HQ board), tier,
hook (why it is fun), `Prerequisite`s (depth reached, a POI kind visited, logs recovered,
reputation, other quests, upgrade levels), `TargetSpec`s to bind, stages of `Objective`
primitives, `Twist`s, a `QuestReward` and authored offer/progress/complete lines. Ids are
stable and saved (Kade 1xx, Mara 2xx, Nix 3xx, Iona 4xx, Pip 5xx, board templates 9xx).

| Primitive | Done when |
|---|---|
| `Deliver` | the owner carries the goods (handed over at turn-in; last stage only) |
| `Reach`, `ReachDepth`, `ReturnToSurface` | a rig gets there |
| `Dig` | rigs drill N tiles in and around the target |
| `Scan` | a scanner pulse near the target |
| `OpenPoi` | the target vault's lock opens, or a crate/core/cache/locker inside it is drilled |
| `Survive` | rigs spend N seconds in and around the target (a hazard pocket) |
| `PickUp` | the owner collects the quest parcel (the fragile twist then counts damage) |
| `Build` | infrastructure of a kind stands at the target |
| `Detonate` | bombs go off at the marked spots in order (a wrong spot resets) |
| `RecoverLog` | the target derelict's salvage core is drilled |
| `Simultaneous` (co-op) | rigs on every marked spot within a crew window, stretched toward the solo one when the crew has fewer rigs than spots (solo: one rig, a long window) |
| `Relay` (co-op) | a marker reaches the target; it overheats after N rows and must be handed to another rig, which can't hand it straight back (solo: it drops and cools) |
| `HoldAndClimb` (co-op) | a rig reaches the goal while the switch is held, anchored by infrastructure, or (solo) still latched |
| `Escort` (co-op) | a slow haul crawls through open tunnel to the surface while rigs walk beside it (faster with two) |
| `SplitDelivery` (co-op) | goods dropped at two buildings within a window (solo: a longer one; a stale half spoils) |

Twists: `TimeLimit`, `Fragile` (hull damage cap), `NoScanner`, `NoBombs`, `StayDown`. A failed
quest is dropped and counted; the giver offers it again.

- **Binding** (`quest::binding`): accepting binds each target to a real feature or POI through
  the feature index (unvisited first, then nearest; places other active quests use are
  avoided) and lays out marked spots; same world, player and quest bind the same places. A
  feature target with nothing in its bands falls back to the nearest bands that have one, then
  to a stand-in kind (an artifact bed for a motherlode, a cavern for a chamber); a row of marks
  that doesn't fit slides inward or stands as a column.
  Board postings (`board_offers`: three a day from the seed and the market day) carry a twist
  pick and a binding salt so they spread over different places.
- **State**: a player's `QuestLog` (active solo quests, completions, failures, reputation,
  blueprint fragments, deepest row, visited POI kinds, the board ledger) is part of `Player` and
  rides in the private `Loadout` section; quests accepted in crew mode (co-op quests with other
  rigs present) live in `CrewQuests` in the shared `Quests` section so every rig sees their
  markers. Everything saves with the world (serde defaults keep older saves loading) and feeds
  the state hash.
- **Rules**: `AcceptQuest`, `TurnInQuest` and `AbandonQuest` are town services validated at the
  giver's counter; objectives advance near the end of each tick from what the tick did (tiles
  mined, blasts, scanner pulses, vault openings, rig positions, infrastructure). Durations are
  authored in milliseconds, so quests behave the same at any tick rate. Crew helpers get a
  quarter of the credits and half the reputation.
- **Reputation** ranks (`REPUTATION_RANKS`: 10/25/50/90) unlock deeper chains and give rebates:
  Pip on fuel, Iona on repairs, Nix on charges (4 % a rank), Kade on cargo sales (+2 % a rank).
- **Blueprints**: `BlueprintId`s collect fragments from quests and vaults; a finished blueprint
  unlocks a rig part (Hauler Engine, Cargo Balloon, Pressure Hull) or records a recipe for later
  systems (dampener, tow winch, outpost refinery).
- **Reading** (`quest::describe`): objective lines, twists, time left and map/world markers.
- **Events**: `QuestAccepted`, `QuestStageDone`, `QuestReady`, `QuestCompleted` (the fanfare),
  `QuestFailed`, `BlueprintCompleted`.

The content suite (`quest/content_tests.rs`) checks that every reference resolves, the unlock
graph is acyclic and fully reachable from a fresh game, co-op primitives have solo variants,
rewards fit their tier's bounds (`QuestTier::reward_bounds`), no quest uses only basic
primitives without a twist or co-op, the first batch keeps its shape (25-35 quests, 4+ givers,
8+ co-op) and every quest binds on 50 seeds, every world option on one seed and seeds that
once failed (`DRILLGAME_QUEST_SEEDS` for more seeds).
`world/quest_tests.rs` plays quests through the tick: solo and crew completions, twists,
rewards, the board, rebates, replication, saves and determinism.

## Replication

Every field belongs to exactly one section kind (the compiler enforces it through exhaustive
destructuring in `section`, `remove_player`, `redact_player` and `split_player`):

| Kind | Contents | Who receives it |
|---|---|---|
| Per tick | rig pose, velocity, fuel, hull, drill/scanner timers, deep-run pressure; gas clouds, boulders, bombs | clients the rig/entity is relevant to |
| Op log | terrain tile writes | everyone, filtered by 16x16 terrain chunk relevance (stale chunks are refreshed with `terrain_chunk`: the chunk's diffs from generation) |
| Op log | per-player discovery | the owner only |
| On change | `RigBuild(player)`: upgrade levels drawn on the rig | everyone |
| On change | `Loadout(player)`: inventory, credits, upgrades, kits, rig parts, POI journal, quest log (solo quests, reputation, blueprint fragments), salvage, rescue count, deep reward milestone, service transactions | the owner only |
| On change | economy, contracts, progression (incl. `won_game`), town, world events, infrastructure, markers, RNG, timers (incl. twin-relay vault deadlines), session constants (tick timing, player template, world settings), crew quests | everyone |

Because other players' private state never reaches a client, replica checks compare
`visible_state_hash(viewer)`: private state is hashed only for the viewer and per-player data is
hashed player by player, so host and a correct client authority agree exactly. Terrain
dimensions, settings and the tiles that differ from generation travel only in keyframes
(`redacted_for(viewer)`); the receiver regenerates the rest.
